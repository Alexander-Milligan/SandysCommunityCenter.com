    <h2>Repository Purpose</h2>
    <p>I am utilizing this GitHub repository to document and manage the ongoing development work for Sandy's community centers' Content Management System (CMS) and website.</p><p>While GitHub is primarily designed for collaborative project development and sharing code with others, I am utilizing it in a unique capacity as a live record of work that cannot be fully showcased. In this context.</p><p>By leveraging GitHub in this manner, I strike a balance between utilizing its powerful tools for efficient project management and safeguarding the privacy of certain aspects of the work that are not intended for public visibility.</p>

    <h2>Website content updating: Brief</h2><h4>Date: 15/01/2024</h4>
    <h4>Due to continuous club changes or new clubs being created, the website's club page is in a continuous state of change. This is where my bespoke CMS comes into play, as most of the text changes and image updates have been handled effortlessly by Sandy's admin staff. I, as the developer, was asked to rearrange areas of content based on the client's requests, while the remaining tasks were completed seamlessly by the CMS.</h4>
