            <p>The following pages have been extracted from the book “The Watsonian 1904–54”, discovered by Bob Allan, Trustee, early in the year 2025.</p>
            <p>These pages represent a short chapter entitled <strong>The Craigmillar Boys’ Club 1935-54</strong>, the contributor being identified only by the initials A.M.M. This chapter describes the founding and early years of what is now “Sandy’s Community Centre”.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">The Craigmillar Boys’ Club 1935-1954</h3>
        <p class="quote">“Boys’ Clubs” said Lord Tweedsmuir, “bring all classes together on the common ground of youth.”</p>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>He was addressing the crowd assembled in the School quadrangle at the opening, on 15th June 1935, of a Garden Fête to raise funds for a boys’ club at Craigmillar. It was to be sponsored by George Watson’s and the Watsonian Club.</p>
            <p>The idea of forming a boys’ club in Craigmillar came from the Watsonian Rover Crew, who had, for many years previously carried on Scout troops and Cub packs in the Old Town. With the movement of population to the suburbs, the Rovers felt that, to maintain its contacts, it must move its centre. At the same time, they determined to expand the scope of their work beyond the limits of the Scout Movement and to draw support from wider resources than they themselves could deploy.</p>
            <p>The measure of the support of the sponsors, on whom the Club was to rely, was at once apparent. At the Garden Fêtes held in 1935 and 1938, over £3000 was raised. Watsonians all over sent donations. For the first five years of its existence, the running expenses of the Club were met almost entirely by the generosity of Watsonian subscribers. So many hands were held out to help the new Club that it would be invidious to mention names. Acknowledgements must, however, be made of the work of Mr John R Little, Dr John Orr, Messrs G M Byres, H J Findlay, and W A Robertson in arousing the enthusiasm of the many. To their names must be added those of David Bogle and Ian Campbell who consented to become respectively Treasurer and Secretary to the Board of Directors.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="section-title">Important Contributors</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Equally important was the finding of leaders. Sandie Somerville had been for many years the Scoutmaster of the Watson’s Troop and had been one of those mainly responsible for the work of the Watsonian Scout Centre. To him, more than to anyone, the Club owes its existence, and he was an automatic choice as the first Club Leader. Watsonians seem to have a natural talent for leadership, and, prior to the war, the Club had no difficulty in mustering some forty Watsonian leaders. Most of them were University students or apprentices, who had little spare time from their studies yet found some time to give to the Club. Among those first leaders, whose enthusiasm and ability set the standard for Craigmillar leaders in later years, may be mentioned Norman Bruce, J L Blair, W N K M Crawford, J C Allan, and G O Horne.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="section-title">Support from the School</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>If, in money and leaders, the main contribution had necessarily come from Watsonians, the contribution made by the School was one which it alone could give. The knowledge and experience possessed by schoolmasters of everything to do with boys is, of course, considerable, and that of headmasters prodigious. Three successive Headmasters and other members of the Staff have been Directors of the Club and have given freely of their specialized knowledge. The services of the Art Department and Mr A D Brown’s film shows have also been much appreciated at Craigmillar. The contacts between Watson’s and Craigmillar boys have been especially valuable to both. Meeting with boys of a totally different social background, whether at camp or on the playing field or at the Club parties, leads to the mutual understanding it is part of the function of the Club to encourage.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Formation of the Ladies’ Committee</h3>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p>One unforeseen result of the first Fête was the formation of the Ladies’ Committee. The ladies, who had given their services on that occasion, were in no mood to terminate their work for the Club when the Fête was over. They formed themselves into a committee, which, under the successive chairmanships of Mrs. Campbell, Mrs. H McPake, Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Carmichael, and Mrs. R T McPake, and over numerous cups of tea, has organized Whist Drives to raise funds for the Club and has done yeoman service at Jumble Sales. Watsonians who have lent a wife or mother to the cause may take pride in the work of the Ladies’ Committee.</p>
